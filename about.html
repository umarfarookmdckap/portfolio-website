        <div class="about-me">
            <p class="about-para"> Hello! My name is Umar Farook M. I completed my 10th standard education at Time Matric Higher Secondary
                School and pursued a diploma in Mechanical Engineering at Polytechnic College. While my educational
                background is in mechanical engineering, I have recently shifted my focus towards web development, a
                field I
                am very passionate about.

                Currently, I am working as a Web Developer Trainee at Dckap, Palli. This role has given me hands-on
                experience in building websites and web applications, allowing me to develop skills in HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, and other web technologies. I enjoy creating user-friendly and responsive web designs and am
                eager to keep learning and growing in this dynamic field.

                I believe my engineering background gives me a unique perspective on problem-solving and attention to
                detail, which I apply in my web development work. I am excited to combine my technical skills and
                creativity
                to build effective digital solutions.

                Thank you for visiting my portfolio! Please take a look at some of the projects I’ve worked on and feel
                free
                to get in touch. </p>
